      <b id="large">Math Team (3 Years Varsity)</b>
      <p class="page_content">
        The UCLS Math Team competes in different math competitions every year. In particular, I have competed
        in many NSML (North Suburban Math League) meets that occur once or twice a month; I also compete in the annual
        ICTM (The Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics) contests and have gone to the State Competition in Urbana
        Champaign, Illinois all three years of High School so far. Math has always been my favorite subject in High School and Math team has furthered my knowledge in it.

      <b id="large">Science Team (3 Years Varsity)</b>
        The UCLS Science Team attends a couple of competitions anually:
        WYSE (Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering), ISO (Illinois Science Olympiad), and TEAMS (Tests of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science).
        I am an avid member of all three of these varsity teams at the Lab Schools. In the WYSE competition, I
        compete in the Computer Science and Engineering Graphics tests; I build the Electric Vehicle involving circuits and programs; I competed in the 2016 National TEAMS competition in Nashville, Tennesse and achieved 5th place in the nation
        for the 8-person competition in which I was a part of.
      <br>
      <b id="large">Code at Lab (1 Year)</b>
      Code@Lab is a new club at lab that has several coding competitions that are attended every year. I have been on the development team for the club's website and programming competitions.
